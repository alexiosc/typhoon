\fBd_open(char *\fPdbname\fB, char *\fPmode\fB)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBd_open\fP opens a database in either shared or exclusive mode.
If the database does not already exist it is created without warning.
The dbd-file must be placed in the path specified by d_dbdpath(1) and 
the database files must be placed in the path specified by d_dbfpath(1).
\fIdbname\fP is the name of the dbd-file without extension.
\fImode\fP is "s" or "x" for shared and exclusive mode, respectively.

If \fBd_open\fP returns \fBS_OKAY\fP the database becomes the current
database.

If the database has already been opened by another process in exclusive
mode, d_open returns S_UNAVAIL.
