No news (is good news).

I've just converted typhoon to a more modernised Debian package, which
should hopefully be useful while we're migrating its dependents
(namely Megistos BBS) to a more modern RDBMS like MySQL.

As a reminder: this is effectively a deprecated package. You don't
need it. Really.
