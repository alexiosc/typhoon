-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Type 'configure' in the typhoon directory and then 'make'.  The output from
the compilation consists of the following files.

    ./include/typhoon.h
    ./include/ansi.h
    ./src/libtyphoon.a
    ./util/ddlp
    ./util/dbdview
    ./util/tyexport
    ./util/tyimport
    ./man/...

If you are installing under OS/2 you must rename the file include/env_os2.h
to include/environ.h before making. To make enter the following:

	cd src
	nmake -f makefile.os2
	cd ../util
	nmake -f makefile.os2
	cd ../examples
	nmake -f makefile.os2

Remember to place typhoon.dll in a directory that is in LIBPATH.
